Open the database musicals.sqlite with sqlite3.

Run the .schema command. What are the three "create table" commands used to create the database tables?

CREATE TABLE "authors"
CREATE TABLE "authors_musicals"
CREATE TABLE "musicals"

[Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals in the database that were first staged in the 1940s. What was the command? What were the results?]

SELECT title FROM musicals WHERE year >= 1940 and year < 1950
Brigadoon
Oklahoma!
South Pacific
Carousel

Write an SQL select command to produce the titles of all the musicals authored by Oscar Hammerstein. What was the command? What were the results?

SELECT title FROM musicals,authors_musicals,authors WHERE authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein" AND author_id = authors.id AND musical_id = musicals.id;
Oklahoma!
South Pacific
Carousel
The Sound of Music

From this point forward, you may use either sqlite3 from the command line or the SQL Manager add-on to Firefox

Insert two new musicals, with their authors and the proper linkage. The musicals are:

Music Man	1957	Meredith Wilson
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Jerry Herman
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Michael Steward

What SQL commands were executed to completely insert the information for Music Man?
INSERT INTO authors_musicals(author_id,musical_id)VALUES(7,11);
INSERT INTO authors(name)VALUES("Meredith Wilson");
INSERT INTO musicals(name,year)VALUES("Music Man",1957);

Rinse & repeat for the other two musicals.  

Create a new table called Actresses with an auto-increment primary key id (integer) and the actress’s name (a string). Populate the table with the following actresses:
Carol Channing
Pearl Bailey
Shirley Jones
Mitzi Gaynor
Mary Martin
Julie Andrews
Cyd Charisse
Audrey Hepburn
Agnes Moorhead
Gwen Verdon
Janis Paige

Create a new linking table called "actresses_musicals" with two integer keys, actress_id and musical_id, and show the SQL command that was executed.
CREATE TABLE "actresses_musicals" ("actress_id" INTEGER, "musical_id" INTEGER);  

Set up the following links between actresses and musicals in the actresses_musicals tabl

Carol Channing	Hello, Dolly
Pearl Bailey	Hello, Dolly
Mary Martin	South Pacific
Mitzi Gaynor	South Pacific
Shirley Jones	Oklahoma!
Cyd Charisse	Brigadoon
Shirley Jones	Carousel
Audrey Hepburn	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	The Sound of Music
Finally, execute an SQL command to list the names of all the actresses who were ever in a play authored by Oscar Hammerstein. Note that this requires a join across all five tables in the database!
å	
ELECT actresses.name FROM actresses,actresses_musicals,authors_musicals,authors,
musicals WHERE authors.name = "Oscar Hammerstein" AND authors.id = authors_musicals.autho
r_id AND actresses.id = actresses_musicals.actress_id AND musicals.id = authors_musicals.musical_id;
