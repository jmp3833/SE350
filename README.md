=====

Content generated throughout the Personal Software Engineering (SE350) course at the Rochester Institute of Technology

Each directory contains a project or activity that was covered in the course. Topics included programs written in 
Ruby (and Ruby on Rails), as well as C. Each activity was structured to learn language fundamentals, as well as some advanced topics such as memory allocation and optimization. 

Practicums contain code that was written in a timed examination format, so some bits may not be fully functional.
Also, code in Practicum directories may be poorly documented, due to the fact that they were developed during a timed examination.
